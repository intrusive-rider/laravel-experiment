My first project on github ğŸ˜«. <br>

> [!NOTE]
> Based on @JeffreyWay (amazing guy) beginner's tutorial on [laracasts ğŸ“º](https://laracasts.com/series/30-days-to-learn-laravel-11).

ğŸ’» Beautifully constructed with:

- [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel)[^1]
- [Tailwind](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss) via [daisyui](https://github.com/saadeghi/daisyui)[^2]
