# laravel-experiment

My first project on GitHub 😫. <br>
    
> [!NOTE]
> Based on [Jeffrey Way](https://github.com/JeffreyWay)'s (amazing guy) beginner's tutorial on [Laracasts 📺](https://laracasts.com/series/30-days-to-learn-laravel-11).

💻 Beautifully constructed with:

- [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel)[^1]
- [Tailwind](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss) via [daisyUI](https://github.com/saadeghi/daisyui)[^2]

[^1]: I take my "I hate PHP" sentiment.
[^2]: Simply revolutionary.
